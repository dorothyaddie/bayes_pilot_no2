<h2>Speed Test</h2>

<p>
The goal of the Speed Test is to observe your performance on a <b>word selection task</b> at different speeds. The word selection task consists of a scrolling list of words moving at a certain speed. Your task will be to select as many <b>fruits</b> as possible in the list of words. You can select and deselect words before they go off-screen by clicking and unclicking them. After completing the current level, you will either move on to more advanced levels or be redirected to the Reasoning Study. Note that speed increases with levels.

<h2>Reasoning Study</h2>

This part of the study consists of a series of 9 tasks consisting of a simultanous task and a questionnaire.<br><br>

You will be asked to answer two questions about the data <b>and</b> to complete the word selection task <b>at the same time</b>. <br><br>
