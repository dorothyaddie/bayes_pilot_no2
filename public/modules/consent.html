<h2>Risk and Visualization</h2>
<p>
We invite you to participate in a research study conducted by
investigators from Washington University in St. Louis.  The purpose of
the study is to evaluate how different representations of Bayesian data impact cognitive load. </p>



<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>In this HIT, you will complete a speed test followed by a series of 9 tasks consisting of a reasoning sheet and a feedback form each.</li>
	<li>The speed test consists of selecting words that are fruits in a scrolling list of words. If we determine that you passed the current level, you will move on to the next level where the speed at which the words are moving will be increased. Once you are done with the speed test, you will be directed to the main task.</li>
	<li>You will get the chance to complete a trial round first. Read the prompt carefully and once you are ready, click on the button to perform the word selection task and answer two questions about the prompt <b>at the same time</b> </li>
	<li>Once you are confident about your answers, click on the Submit button. You will be redirected to a questionnaire about the task. Answer the questions as truthfully as possible.</li>
	<li>You will answer 9 such tasks in total with different prompts.</li>
	<li>Finally, we will conduct a short spatial ability test and a visual memory test. </li>
	<li>Then you will be prompted for some basic demographic information questions (age, gender, and education). </li>
	<li> The avarage completion time is 30 minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Payment</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>You will receive a base pay of $1.00 for your participation</li>
		<li><strong>Additional Bonus:</strong> We will determine your bonus based on how you perform in the 9 reasoning sheets and the spatial ability test. In each sheet, you will receive $1 if you answer both questions correctly and $0.5 if you only answer one question correctly. If you hit 100% of the fruit words in the word selection task, you will receive $0.5. You will lose $0.05 for every wrong or missed word. In the spatial ability test, you can receive up to $2 <b> Your maximum total bonus is $15.50 </b>  </li>
	</ul>
</ul>
